# Define a GitHub workflow for deployment to Azure App Service
# Use push event to trigger the workflow
# First job is to build the app and publish it as an artifact
# Second job is the run the unit tests
# Third job is to deploy the app to Azure App Service
# Publish profile is stored as a secret in the GitHub repository
# Azure credentials are stored as a secret in the GitHub repository
# Azure credentials are used to create a service principal
# Service principal is used to deploy the app to Azure App Service
